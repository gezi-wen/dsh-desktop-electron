/**
 * Orphan reaper for the dsh-desktop server child. No OS delivers a
 * parent-death notification, so a hard-killed Electron main (Task Manager,
 * `taskkill`, a crash) would leave `dsh web` and its tree running forever on
 * any platform. This script polls the main process's PID and, when it is
 * gone, tree-kills the server child and exits. Runs under Electron-as-Node;
 * its only inputs are the two PIDs on argv.
 *
 * The tree kill is delegated to the `process-tree.ts` primitive
 * (taskkill /T /F on Windows; SIGTERM with SIGKILL escalation against the
 * server's detached process group on POSIX). Its Promise keeps this process
 * alive through taskkill completion on Windows or verified process-group
 * quiescence on POSIX; the reaper then exits when the event loop drains.
 *
 * Usage: node reaper.js <mainPid> <serverPid>
